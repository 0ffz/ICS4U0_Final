# ICS4U0 Final Project - Don't Get Hurt, Stay at Work

This is our submission for our final project in the ICS4U0 course, where we had to create a game with the topic of adversity in Java. Our game covers safety in the workplace, presented as a turn-based RPG inspired by Undertale. It is coded with JavaFX, so the project should be easy to setup within any IDE running Java 8.

##### Setting up source code

1. First, clone this repository.
2. We strongly recommend using IntelliJ, as the project should be almost ready to work with, using it. Simply open the project's root directory in IntelliJ and the project should load.
3. Next, go to `File > Project Sructure` (shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S`), go to the `Project` tab and set your JDK to `Java 8`. You may need to create the JDK by pressing the `New` button and linking to where it is installed. On Windows, this is `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_<version>` by default.
4. Run the `Main.java` file under `src` by opening it, and pressing `Ctrl+Shift+F10`
